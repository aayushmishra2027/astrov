            <h2>Black Holes</h2>
            <p>Black holes are regions of spacetime exhibiting gravitational acceleration so strong that nothing can escape from it.</p>
            <p>A Back Hole is a region in space where the gravitational pull is so strong that not even light can escape from it. They form when massive stars collapse under their own gravity at the end of their life cycles. The boundary surrounding a black hole is called the event horizon, beyond which nothing can return.</p>
            <p>Black Holes can be classified into different types based on their size and mass:</p>
        </section>
        <section id="black holes">
            <ul>
           <li><strong>Stellar Black Holes:</strong> Formed from the remnants of massive stars after they explode in supernovae. These black holes have masses up to 20 times that of our Sun.</li>
           <li><strong>Supermassive Black Holes:</strong> Found at the centers of galaxies, including our Milky Way, these black holes have masses ranging from millions to billions of times that of the Sun.</li>
           <li><strong>Intermediate Black Holes:</strong> These are black holes with masses between stellar and supermassive black holes, but their existence is still a topic of research and debate.</li>
           <li><strong>Primordial Black Holes:</strong> Hypothetical black holes that may have formed soon after the Big Bang, with masses ranging from very small to very large.</li>

            <h2>Neutron Stars</h2>
          <p>Neutron stars are the remnants of massive stars that have undergone supernova explosions. They are incredibly dense, with masses around 1.4 times that of the Sun but only about 20 kilometers in diameter.</p>

                <h3>Formation of Neutron Stars</h3>
            <p>Neutron stars form when a star with a mass greater than approximately 8 times that of the Sun exhausts its nuclear fuel. The core collapses under gravity, and protons and electrons combine to form neutrons, resulting in a neutron star. The outer layers of the star are blown off in a supernova explosion.</p>

            <h3>Characteristics of Neutron Stars</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Density and Gravity:</strong> Neutron stars have incredibly high densities, with a gravitational pull that is billions of times stronger than Earth's gravity. This intense gravity significantly warps spacetime around the star.</li>
                <li><strong>Composition:</strong> Neutron stars are primarily composed of neutrons, subatomic particles with no electrical charge. They may also have a thin crust of atomic nuclei and electrons.</li>
                <li><strong>Magnetic Fields:</strong> Neutron stars have extremely strong magnetic fields, which can be trillions of times stronger than Earth's magnetic field. These magnetic fields can accelerate particles to near-light speeds.</li>
                <li><strong>Rotation:</strong> Neutron stars can rotate very rapidly, sometimes hundreds of times per second. These rapidly rotating neutron stars are known as pulsars.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Pulsars</h3>
            <p>Pulsars are a type of neutron star that emits beams of electromagnetic radiation from their magnetic poles. As the neutron star rotates, these beams sweep across space. If one of the beams points towards Earth, we see a pulse of radiation, hence the name pulsar. Pulsars are used by astronomers as precise cosmic clocks due to their regular pulsing signals.</p>

            <h3>Types of Neutron Stars</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Radio Pulsars:</strong> Emit radio waves detectable from Earth. They are the most commonly observed type of pulsar.</li>
                <li><strong>X-ray Pulsars:</strong> Emit X-rays and are often found in binary systems, where the neutron star is accreting material from a companion star.</li>
                <li><strong>Magnetars:</strong> Neutron stars with extremely strong magnetic fields. They can emit powerful bursts of X-rays and gamma rays.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Observing Neutron Stars</h3>
            <p>Neutron stars can be observed across different wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum, including radio, optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray. Observatories like the Hubble Space Telescope, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, and radio telescopes around the world are instrumental in studying these enigmatic objects.</p>

            <h3>Importance of Neutron Stars</h3>
            <p>Neutron stars are valuable to astronomers because they serve as natural laboratories for studying the properties of matter under extreme conditions. The study of neutron stars can also provide insights into the life cycles of stars, the behavior of matter at nuclear densities, and the nature of fundamental forces in the universe.</p>
